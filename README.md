# Algorithm-Visualiser

Understanding becomes sharp when we are able to visualise them, so here we have Algrorithm visualiser, that helps you to see working of standard algorithms, such as:
<br> 1.) Graph Algorithms : Dijkastra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm, Breath First Search, Depth First Search.
<br> 2.) Sorting Algorithms : Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort.
