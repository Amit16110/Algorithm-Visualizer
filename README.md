# Algorithm-Visualiser

Understanding becomes sharp when we are able to visualise them, so here we have Algrorithm visualiser, that helps you to see working of standarad algorithms, such as:
<br> 1.) Graph Algorithms
<br> &emsp;  1.1) Dijkastra's Algorithm
<br> &emsp;  1.2) A* Algorithm
<br> &emsp;  1.3) Breath First Search
<br> &emsp;  1.4) Depth First Search
<br> 2.) Sorting Algorithms
<br> &emsp;  2.1) Bubble sort
<br> &emsp;  2.2) Insertion sort
<br> &emsp;  2.3) Selection sort
<br> &emsp;  2.4) Merge sort
<br> &emsp;  2.5) Quick sort
<br> &emsp;  2.6) Heap sort
